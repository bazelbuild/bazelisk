A user-friendly launcher for Bazel
 Bazelisk is a wrapper for Bazel written in Go. It automatically picks a good
 version of Bazel given your current working directory, downloads it from the
 official server (if required) and then transparently passes through all
 command-line arguments to the real Bazel binary. You can call it just like you
 would call Bazel.
